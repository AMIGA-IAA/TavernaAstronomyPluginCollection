{"name":"Taverna astronomy plugin collection","tagline":"","body":"### Outline.\r\nThis project aims to join efforts toward the use of scientific workflows in astronomy. In particular, we are developing Taverna plugins to improve the astronomer experience with [Taverna workbench](http://www.taverna.org.uk/).\r\nCurrently, there are two main contributions:\r\n* [AstroTaverna plugin]().\r\n* [VAMDC plugin](http://vamdc.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/taverna/vamdc/).\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n\r\nTo install the plugins to Taverna:\r\n\r\n* Download and install Taverna 2.4\r\n* Start Taverna\r\n* Add a plugin site: http://julian-garrido.github.com/TavernaAstronomyPluginCollection/ \r\n* Restart Taverna\r\n\r\n\r\n### Astrotaverna\r\n[AstroTaverna](http://asterisk.apod.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=31653) is a plugin for Taverna Workbench that provides the means to build astronomy workflows using Virtual Observatory services discovery and efficient manipulation of VOTables (based on STIL tool set). It integrates SAMP-enabled software, allowing data exchange and communication among local VO tools, as well as the ability to execute Aladin scripts and macros. \r\n\r\nFor more information, watch our [video tutorial](http://vimeo.com/51095004) or go to the [AstroTaverna starter pack](http://www.myexperiment.org/packs/420.html) that includes a compilation of examples with example input data and descriptions.\r\n\r\nAstroTaverna is maintained by [wf4ever](https://github.com/wf4ever)\r\n####History\r\nVersion 1.09\r\n* Configuration of PDL artifact to work with PDL server, rest services, and extended descriptions for rest services that returns VOTables.\r\n* Solve bug parsing paths in Aladin scripts and macros under Windows platform.\r\nVersion 1.08\r\n* Update names and descriptions of services.\r\n* Include Aladin script and macro artifacts.\r\n\r\n### VAMDC\r\nVAMDC has integrated plugins into the Taverna Workflow System to run XSAMS Queries, and particular Codes of the VAMDC. \r\n\r\nVAMDC plugin is maintained by [VAMDC](https://github.com/VAMDC)\r\n\r\n#### History\r\nVersion 2.4.0:\r\n* Update for new release of Taverna 2.4.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
